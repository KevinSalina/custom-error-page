# Custom Error Page

## Instructions
In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with a set of static web assets. Your task is to implement an HTTP server to serve up these assets when they are requested. A request to a specific asset should return that asset (ex. index.html). A request to a non-existent asset should result in the user seeing the 404.html page. This exercise will be completed in class.
